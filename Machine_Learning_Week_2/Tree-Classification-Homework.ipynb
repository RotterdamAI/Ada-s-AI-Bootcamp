    "Consider an example where we are building a decision tree to predict whether a loan given to a person would result in a write-off or not. Our entire population consists of 30 instances. 16 belong to the write-off class and the other 14 belong to the non-write-off class. We have two features, namely “Balance” that can take on two values -> “< 50K” or “>50K” and “Residence” that can take on three values -> “OWN”, “RENT” or “OTHER”. \n",
