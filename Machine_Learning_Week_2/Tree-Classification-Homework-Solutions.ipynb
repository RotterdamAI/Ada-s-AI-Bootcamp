    "Consider an example where we are building a decision tree to predict whether a loan given to a person would result in a write-off or not. Our entire population consists of 30 instances. 16 belong to the write-off class and the other 14 belong to the non-write-off class. We have two features, namely “Balance” that can take on two values -> “< 50K” or “>50K” and “Residence” that can take on three values -> “OWN”, “RENT” or “OTHER”. \n",

    "Your tasks are to demonstrate how a decision tree algorithm would decide what attribute to split on first and what feature provides more information, or reduces more uncertainty about our target variable out of the two using the concepts of Entropy and Information Gain."
